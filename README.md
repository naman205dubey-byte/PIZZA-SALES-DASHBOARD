# PIZZA-SALES-DASHBOARD

An interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into pizza sales performance, customer preferences, and ordering patterns. The dashboard enables restaurant managers and stakeholders to track revenue, order trends, pizza categories, and seasonal demand, supporting data-driven decision-making.

 ### Short Description / Purpose

The Pizza Sales Dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize sales data for a pizza restaurant. It highlights total revenue, order volume, average order value, and category-wise performance, allowing users to quickly identify top-selling pizzas, popular order sizes, and demand patterns by time and season.

### Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform.

📂 Power Query – For cleaning, shaping, and transforming raw sales data.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – To create calculated measures such as revenue, order value, and totals.

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among orders, pizzas, and categories to allow cross-filtering.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for previews.

### Data Source

Source: Pizza Sales Dataset (sample dataset used for analytics).
The dataset includes order-level details such as:

Order ID, Date, and Time

Pizza category (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken)

Pizza size (S, M, L, XL, XXL)

### Features / Highlights

Business Problem

Which pizza category sells the most?

Which size is most preferred by customers?

What are the busiest days of the week for orders?

How do monthly sales trends vary across the year?

Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a visually engaging tool that helps restaurant owners and analysts:

Monitor total revenue, orders, and pizzas sold.

Identify top-performing categories and sizes.

Analyze customer buying patterns across weekdays and months.

Optimize operations and marketing strategies based on demand insights.
